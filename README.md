# Hospitality-PowerBI-Dashboard
I used the STAR method to create a dashboard that provides valuable insights into the company's revenue and performance in the luxury/business hotel category, helping them regain market share and drive revenue growth through the identification of key trends and areas for improvement.  Situation: Atliq Grands, a leading hospitality company in India, was experiencing declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.  Task: As a data analyst, I was hired by Atliq Grands to create a dashboard using their historical data to help them regain their market share and drive revenue growth.  Action: I worked with the company's revenue management team to create the metrics for the dashboard and design it according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders. I also looked for additional insights that were not included in the metric list or mock-up to provide additional value to the company.  Result: Through my analysis, we were able to identify key trends and areas for improvement. The dashboard has been well-received by the company and we believe it will be a valuable tool in helping Atliq Grands regain its market share and drive revenue growth.
